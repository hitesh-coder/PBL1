            <h3><span>Project Title :</span>Maintaining a traffic control at rush places using IOT</h3>
            <p>
                <span>Objective :</span>
                Handling a traffic issue at rush places in metro cities by using smart systems
                <br><br>

                <span>Problem statement :</span>
                In metro cities, traffic issue is a major issue. So this issue can be handled by using sensors.
                <br><br>

                <span>Solution :</span>
                Now we are considering that we want to go to a movie or drama shows in our city. Those places are full
                of rush. The user will check for ticket availability for the show he want. We will create a website in
                which we are feeding data as area of that parking. Also, we are inserting a one sensor which will keep
                track of how many vehicles are entering in the parking. Along with area of parking we are feeding area
                required for one vehicle. (This calculations we are doing by consideration of two wheeler parking) Then
                as vehicles will enter the parking count will be incremented and if vehicle leaves parking then count is
                decremented.
                Before going to the place that user wants he will check first at our website and will check is the space
                available. If space is available we will display a message that “yes you can go “,otherwise it will
                display “no you have to wait”. In this we are dealing with one parking area which we select and we will
                insert sensor at that place.

            <h3><span>Project Title :</span>Smart alarm clock system </h3>
            <p>
                <span>Objective :</span>
                To build a smart alarm clock system which can perform multiple functions like play latest news as
                podcast, play local mp3 files, etc.
                <br><br>

                <span>Problem statement :</span>
                Along with normal operation of alarm, it should able to perform some additional features. The system
                should able to play latest news as podcast, audio amplifier volume control, play internet radio
                station,etc.

                <br><br>

                <span>Solution :</span>
                We will use a Raspberry pi zero. First thing is to flash an SSD card. Also we are using audio amplifier
                which can be used for volume control. Then, for displaying we need some changes in coding. The model
                comes together with 14 segment alphanumeric LED feather wing containing driver chip, which handles
                multiplexing of commands. This system can connect to my calendar so it knows my schedule of the day.
                Also it would also connect to live traffic and public transport data. Due to this data user can detect
                how much time it will need to go to desired place.
                Main functionality of Alarm is to ring to wake up early at morning. Along with this alarm system should
                able to perform some other functionality. The system will wholly based on iot. So this system can be
                used for performing other functions.
