            <h3><span>Project Title :</span>Fair car value prediction</h3>
            <p>
                <span>Objective :</span>
                To predict price of an used car
                <br><br>

                <span>Problem statement :</span>
                Making a ML model to predict price of an used car by using its features and by taking its lifetime into
                consideration .
                <br><br>

                <span>Solution :</span>
                In this we will train a model with some data set of the features of a used car like mileage, how many
                kilometers it has travelled, if it has some scratches or anything and some more feature These features
                will be used to predict the price of the car.
            </p>

            <h3><span>Project Title :</span>Corona predicting model</h3>
            <p>
                <span>Objective :</span>
                To predict the chances of having a covid-19 infection using some data set
                <br><br>

                <span>Problem statement :</span>
                To make a ML model which will be used to predict if a person have a chance of covid-19 infection or not
                depending of his symptoms.
                <br><br>

                <span>Solution :</span>
                We will train a model using symptoms that a covid-19 positive patient gets and will create a data set
                depending using those symptoms and their severity.
                The model which we will train depending on the data sets available will predict the chances of that
                person getting corona infection.
